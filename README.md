# CS305
Artemis Financial wanted to modernize their security protocols by updating them to the newest available.I was able to perform a dependency check to pinpoint areas that needed to be updated to increase the effectiveness of security. Its important to code securely to protect their customer's privacy, and to ensure that data transmission is not susceptible to attacks. This adds to the companies well-being by being a trusted company to utilize for financial transactions. I increased layers of security by approaching the assesment using multiple techniques including static testing, algorithm ciphers, and self-signed certificates. In the future, I would perform use Maven to perform a dependency check and use OWASP to help identify areas to increase security, and determine which can ben suppressed based on their needs. After refactoring the code, I made sure that the program had a successful build, and re-ran the vulnerability scan. From this assignment, I would show that I know how to update the pom file to run a dependency check, and use owasp to diagnose areas in need of increased security.
